# Project Description

Following the methods of Wang et al in _A comprehensive study design reveals treatment- and transcript abundanceâ€“dependent concordance between RNA-seq and microarray data_ we sought out to recreate the analysis from this paper, which was to determine the concordance of microarray and RNA-seq technologies. Data was provided as a part of BF528.
